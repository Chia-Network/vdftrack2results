Results from track 2, best discriminant break, are finalized. Congratulations to the anonymous teammates who will share the first place prize of $27,000. They used precalculated discriminants that were then fed into the quadclassunit function of the PARI/GP library (240 and 224 bit break examples are included in the publicized entry). The $13,000 second place prize was awarded to akashnil with a 181 bit discriminant triplet broken using a method attributed to D. Shanks. Thank you to everyone who participated in the contest!
