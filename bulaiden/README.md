## Submission

This is a submission to the VDF contest for track 2, which includes the required open source license, and entry.txt with three lines in the following format:


challenge(in hex) length a b c order

## Description

This submission uses GMP library for arithmetic and Euler product to generate an estimate of the order, and Baby-Step Giant-Step to search for the exact order, and small encoding of forms to permit larger Baby table.

The Euler Product technique is described in A Course in Computational Algebraic Number Theory, by Henri Cohen
